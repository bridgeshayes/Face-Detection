# FacialDetection

## Author: Garrett Hayes

This is an application that uses the opencv and numpy libraries as well as dlib to detect the number of faces in the webcam.

# NOTE: 
This application WILL NOT work unless the opencv, numpy and dlib libraries are installed. The dlib library also only works with Python 3.9 or below!
